# Topic-Modeling-by-Gensim

## Gensim
Gensim is an open-source library for unsupervised topic modeling and natural language processing, using modern statistical machine learning. Gensim is implemented in Python and Cython.

Gensim is a Python library for topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora. Target audience is the natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) community.

Features

All algorithms are memory-independent w.r.t. the corpus size (can process input larger than RAM, streamed, out-of-core)

Intuitive interfaces

a)easy to plug in your own input corpus/datastream (simple streaming API)

b)easy to extend with other Vector Space algorithms (simple transformation API)

Efficient multicore implementations of popular algorithms, such as online Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA/LSI/SVD), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Random Projections (RP), Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) or word2vec deep learning.

Distributed computing: can run Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation on a cluster of computers.

A)Gensim stands for "Generate Similar"

B)Features provided by Gensim :

fastText
word2vec
LSA
LDA
TF-IDF
